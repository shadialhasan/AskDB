# @askdb/config

## 1.0.0-beta.13

### Minor Changes

- e57c734: Fix AI adapter correctness bugs that the AI SDK silently ignored.
  
  **@askdb/ai-azure**: Embedding `dimensions`/`user` are now sent. They were wrapped under `providerOptions.azure`, but `@ai-sdk/azure` builds embeddings with `OpenAIEmbeddingModel`, which reads only `providerOptions.openai`, so they were dropped. `reasoningEffort` now also sets `forceReasoning: true`. The AI SDK decides whether a model can reason from the model id it was given, which on Azure is the deployment name. Without this flag, a deployment such as `askdb-reporting` backed by `modelFamily: "gpt-5"` silently lost its reasoning effort. The missing-resource error now names the config keys (`ai.providerConfig.azure.resourceName` / `baseUrl`) and gives the `AZURE_RESOURCE_NAME` env alternative.
  
  **@askdb/ai-google**: Embeddings use the non-deprecated `google.embedding()` and now honor `dimensions`, mapped to Gemini's `outputDimensionality`.
  
  **@askdb/ai-openai / @askdb/ai-azure**: Reasoning-model detection no longer treats `gpt-5-chat*` (non-reasoning chat models) as reasoning models. It now recognizes gpt-5 point releases and later majors (`gpt-5.1`, `gpt-6`, …). gpt-6 and later accept `low` through `max` but not `minimal`, so a `minimal` effort is sent as `low` for them. This covers Azure deployments with a custom name and `modelFamily: "gpt-6"`, where the SDK can't see the family and would otherwise send `minimal`.
  
  **@askdb/ai-anthropic**: Reasoning-model detection now follows `@ai-sdk/anthropic`'s capability table. Claude Sonnet 4.6, Opus 4.6+, and the 5.x models (Opus 5, Sonnet 5, Fable 5, …) get adaptive thinking (`thinking: { type: "adaptive" }` plus `effort`) instead of the manual `budgetTokens` form, which newer models reject. Claude Haiku 4.5 now gets extended thinking.
  
  **@askdb/ai**: `aiKeyMissingMessage` now lists Anthropic. `aiProviderMissingMessage` maps aliases to the package that owns them (for example, `foundry` points to `@askdb/ai-azure`). It no longer suggests a nonexistent `@askdb/ai-<name>` package for custom providers. `withEmbeddingProviderOptions` takes an optional fourth argument that maps the portable `dimensions`/`user` options to a provider's own setting names; `@askdb/ai-google` now uses it instead of its own wrapper.
  
  **@askdb/config**: `AzureConfig` / `FoundryConfig` gain `resourceName`, which is flattened to the key the Azure adapter reads. Before this, a config-only Azure setup couldn't supply a resource name and failed at startup. `ASKDB_AI_PROVIDERS` now includes `"anthropic"`. New `@askdb/config/scaffold` entry point for tools that write a new `askdb.config.ts`: `renderAskDbAiConfigScaffold` renders its `ai` block and lists the env vars it reads, and `askdb init` and Studio's setup wizard both use it. The main entry is unchanged apart from `resourceName` and `ASKDB_AI_PROVIDERS`.
  
  **askdb / @askdb/studio**: `askdb init --ai-provider azure|foundry` and Studio's setup wizard (Azure OpenAI or Foundry) scaffold `resourceName: env("AZURE_RESOURCE_NAME")` and list `AZURE_RESOURCE_NAME` in `.env.example`, so the generated config works out of the box. `askdb init`'s `.env.example` now puts a one-line comment above each AI variable, and lists the SQLite file variable (`SQLITE_FILE` or the `--sqlite-file` env name) when the config reads one. It now also lists `DATABASE_URL` for `--database prisma --studio-execute` and `ASKDB_PGVECTOR_URL` for `--rag-store pgvector` without `--pgvector-env`, both of which the config read but `.env.example` left out, and lists each variable once. `--sqlite-file` now treats only an env-name-shaped value (`UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`) as a variable; a relative path such as `data.db` or `../db/app.db` is written as a literal path instead of `env("data.db")`.
- f506c14: - `@askdb/config`: new `isAskDbDebugEnabled()` export. It returns `true` when the `ASKDB_DEBUG` shell variable is `1` or `true` (case-insensitive), and reads `process.env` directly so binaries can use it when the config fails to load. The `askdb` CLI uses it to decide whether to print stack traces.
  - `@askdb/studio`: when `askdb.config.*` exists but fails to load, `askdb-studio` (and `askdb studio`) print `askdb-studio: warning: <path> could not be loaded, so Studio is ignoring it: <error>` and start without it, instead of starting silently. The setup wizard still never overwrites an existing config.
  - Docs: the CLI reference documents `--help`/`--version`, which commands work without a config, the missing-config message, and `ASKDB_DEBUG`; troubleshooting matches the real missing-config error and covers configs that fail to load.
- c6e289a: The OpenAI, Azure OpenAI / Foundry, Google, and Anthropic providers are now built into `@askdb/ai`. The `@askdb/ai-*` packages are deprecated (ADR 0006 amendment, Option E).
  
  **@askdb/ai**: ships the four providers (moved unchanged from `@askdb/ai-*`) plus a new zero-dependency `gateway` provider for the Vercel AI Gateway (`AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY`, model ids like `openai/gpt-4o-mini`). Each provider loads its AI SDK package lazily, the first time it builds a model. `@ai-sdk/openai`, `@ai-sdk/azure`, `@ai-sdk/google`, and `@ai-sdk/anthropic` are now **optional peer dependencies**: install the one for the provider you configure. If it's missing, model creation fails with `Provider 'google' requires the optional peer dependency @ai-sdk/google. Install it: npm i @ai-sdk/google`. The peer ranges are `^4.0.0` (the contract tests pass against 4.0.0), so a host on an older 4.x SDK isn't forced to upgrade. The lazy imports are written so esbuild builds without the SDKs a host didn't install. webpack 5 doesn't: see the webpack note under the deprecated packages below.
  
  - `createAiRegistry()` with no arguments registers every built-in provider. It also accepts built-in names and aliases (`createAiRegistry(["openai"])`), mixed freely with `AiProviderAdapter` objects. Custom adapters work unchanged.
  - New exports: `BUILTIN_AI_PROVIDERS` (one table of names, aliases, env vars, default models, and SDK packages), `getBuiltinAiProviderSetup`, `listBuiltinAiProviderSetups`, the adapters `openaiProvider` / `azureProvider` / `googleProvider` / `anthropicProvider` / `gatewayProvider`, and the `AiProviderSelector` type.
  - `aiProviderMissingMessage` now says to pass the built-in name to `createAiRegistry()` and to install `@ai-sdk/<provider>`, instead of naming an `@askdb/ai-*` package. `aiKeyMissingMessage` also lists the gateway.
  - The `gateway` provider maps reasoning effort through its upstream (`openai/`, `google/`, `anthropic/` model ids), sends embedding `dimensions` for `openai/` and `google/` models and refuses them for other upstreams, and rejects model ids without an `<upstream>/` prefix.
  - The `openai` provider now also sends `forceReasoning: true` with a reasoning effort, so an `@ai-sdk/openai` release that predates a model family (gpt-6 before 4.0.60) still sends it.
  - The built-in adapters' `createLanguageModel` / `createEmbeddingModel` are now `async`. The `AiProviderAdapter` contract already allowed promises, and `AiRegistry` methods were already async.
  
  **@askdb/ai-openai, @askdb/ai-azure, @askdb/ai-google, @askdb/ai-anthropic (deprecated)**: each now only re-exports its adapter from `@askdb/ai`, which it depends on directly (it was a peer). It keeps its `@ai-sdk/*` dependency, so existing installs and imports keep working, except in a webpack bundle. These packages will be removed before 1.0 (#347).
  
  **webpack users, including shim users who change nothing:** importing `@askdb/client`, `@askdb/ai`, or a shim now reaches every built-in provider's `import("@ai-sdk/<x>")`, and webpack 5 fails with `Module not found: Error: Can't resolve '@ai-sdk/google'` (and the other SDKs you don't have). Before this release, `@askdb/client` + `@askdb/ai-openai` bundled without the other SDKs. Install all four `@ai-sdk/*` packages, or mark the ones you don't use as `externals` (with ESM output, use `externalsType: "module"` and the bare package names):
  
  ```js
  // webpack.config.js: list the @ai-sdk/* packages you don't install.
  module.exports = {
    // ...
    externals: {
      "@ai-sdk/anthropic": "commonjs @ai-sdk/anthropic",
      "@ai-sdk/azure": "commonjs @ai-sdk/azure",
      "@ai-sdk/google": "commonjs @ai-sdk/google",
    },
  };
  ```
  
  A provider whose SDK isn't installed then fails at runtime with the install message. esbuild needs no change.
  
  To migrate:
  
  ```diff
  - npm i @askdb/ai-openai
  + npm i @askdb/ai @ai-sdk/openai
  
  - import { openaiProvider } from "@askdb/ai-openai";
  - const askdb = createAskDb({ config, providers: [openaiProvider] });
  + const askdb = createAskDb({ config }); // or providers: ["openai"]
  
  - const ai = createAiRegistry([openaiProvider]);
  + const ai = createAiRegistry(["openai"]);
  ```
  
  **@askdb/client**: `createAskDb({ config })` no longer throws when neither `providers` nor `registry` is passed. It registers every built-in `@askdb/ai` provider, and `ai.provider` in the config picks one. `providers` also accepts built-in names. The four `@ai-sdk/*` packages are declared as optional peers (`^4.0.0`) so strict installs such as Yarn Plug'n'Play pass the host's SDK through to `@askdb/ai`.
  
  **@askdb/config**: new `ai.provider: "gateway"` branch (`providerConfig.gateway.{apiKey, baseUrl, model}`, flattened to `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` / `ASKDB_AI_BASE_URL` / `ASKDB_AI_MODEL`). `ASKDB_AI_PROVIDERS` includes `"gateway"`. `DEFAULT_ANTHROPIC_CHAT_MODEL`, `DEFAULT_GOOGLE_CHAT_MODEL`, and `DEFAULT_GATEWAY_CHAT_MODEL` are now exported. A test in `@askdb/client` (which depends on both) fails if this list, these defaults, or the env var names `flatten` writes drift from the built-in provider table. `askdb init` and Studio's setup wizard take each provider's default API key and model env var names from `@askdb/ai`'s provider table instead of keeping their own copies.
  
  **askdb, @askdb/http-api, @askdb/studio**: register providers with `createAiRegistry()` and depend on `@askdb/ai` plus all four `@ai-sdk/*` packages instead of `@askdb/ai-*`. They still work from env/config alone. `askdb init` and Studio setup now take their provider choices and scaffolded env var names from `@askdb/ai`'s table, and both offer the Vercel AI Gateway. Google now scaffolds `GOOGLE_AI_MODEL`, the variable the provider actually reads, instead of `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_MODEL`. Studio's "Get the code" snippet uses `@askdb/client` + `@ai-sdk/<provider>`. `askdb help init` lists every `--ai-provider` value, including `gateway`.
  
  **@askdb/rag**: the deprecation note on `createOpenAiEmbedder` now points at `createAiRegistry(["openai"])` instead of the `@askdb/ai-openai` adapter.
- 9021e54: Raise the supported Node floor from `>=22.12` to `>=22.14` (`engines.node` in every published package). `better-sqlite3` 13, which the `@askdb/sqlite` and `@askdb/studio` peer ranges allow, segfaults on Node 22.12.0 through 22.13.1 and works from 22.14.0 (bisected on linux-x64; upstream WiseLibs/better-sqlite3#1514). Hosts on Node 22.12 or 22.13 should upgrade to Node 22.14 or newer.

### Patch Changes

- 0009bb1: Raise `dotenv` to `^18.0.4`. 17.4.2 (April 2026) was the last 17.x release, and dotenv's fixes now ship on 18.x only. `bootstrapAskDbEnv` loads `.env` files the same way, still quietly. dotenv 18 drops `.env.vault` support, so setting `DOTENV_KEY` no longer makes `bootstrapAskDbEnv` decrypt a `.env.vault` file.

## 1.0.0-beta.12

### Minor Changes

- 5dbe2d6: **MySQL/MariaDB: introspect several databases at once.**

  **@askdb/mysql**: The MySQL connector honors `filters.schemas` as a list of databases (MySQL's "schemas"). Each listed database becomes its own namespace in the artifact (`table:sales.orders`), and foreign keys that cross databases keep the referenced database. `filters.excludeSchemas` removes entries from the list. Before this change the connector read only the connection's database (`DATABASE()`) and silently ignored `filters.schemas`. Without a list, behavior is unchanged: the connection's database is read and rendered under the `public` namespace. The exported `MYSQL_CATALOG_SQL` strings now also select `table_schema` (and `referenced_table_schema` for foreign keys).

  **@askdb/config**: New `introspection.schemas?: string[]`, the config equivalent of `askdb introspect --schemas`, for every provider (on MySQL/MariaDB, the databases to introspect). Runtime config exposes it as `introspection.schemas`.

  **askdb**: `askdb introspect` reads `introspection.schemas` from config for any engine; `--schemas` overrides it.

  **@askdb/studio**: Resync passes the configured schema list to the connector, so it matches `askdb introspect`.

- 933bd6c: **@askdb/studio** (security): Playground execute is now opt-in, runs one read-only statement at a time, and has a timeout and a row cap.

  - **Off by default.** `POST /api/execute` returns `403` with setup instructions until `studio.execute.enabled: true` is set. The Playground hides the Execute button and shows why. `/api/execute/status` now reports `enabled`, `disabledReason`, `timeoutMs`, and `maxRows`.
  - **No silent credential reuse.** Execute no longer falls back to the introspection connection. Set `studio.execute.databaseUrl` / `file`, ideally for a read-only role, or opt in with `studio.execute.useIntrospectionConnection: true`. This is a breaking change for projects that relied on the fallback.
  - **Validated before execution.** Every query must pass `@askdb/core`'s `validateSelectSql` for the execute engine's dialect. Otherwise the request fails with `400` and never reaches the driver. SQL that reads `sensitive` columns returns `warnings`.
  - **One read-only statement.** Postgres forces the extended query protocol, so `SELECT 1; COMMIT; DROP …` can no longer escape `BEGIN READ ONLY`, and turns on `default_transaction_read_only`. MySQL and MariaDB use a prepared statement in `START TRANSACTION READ ONLY`. SQL Server runs inside `SET XACT_ABORT ON; BEGIN TRANSACTION … ROLLBACK`. SQL Server has no read-only mode, so use a read-only login.
  - **Timeouts and row caps.** Queries time out after 30 s by default (`studio.execute.timeoutMs`; not enforced for SQLite). Studio fetches at most `studio.execute.maxRows + 1` rows (default 500) and reports `truncated` and `rowLimit`, instead of loading every row and slicing.
  - **Bounded requests.** JSON bodies over 1 MiB return `413`. Playground history keeps only known fields with length limits. Studio adds `playground-history.json` to the schema directory's `.gitignore`, creating the file with `.env` rules if it doesn't exist.
  - **Driver install.** Inherited keys such as `constructor` are rejected with `400`, and installs now work on Windows. The setup wizard and install endpoint share one package-manager spawn helper.
  - The setup wizard now defaults Studio execute to off, and choosing it writes `enabled: true`.

  **@askdb/config**: New `studio.execute` fields, each with a canonical flat key: `enabled` (`ASKDB_STUDIO_EXECUTE_ENABLED`, default `false`), `useIntrospectionConnection` (`ASKDB_STUDIO_EXECUTE_USE_INTROSPECTION_CONNECTION`, default `false`), `timeoutMs` (`ASKDB_STUDIO_EXECUTE_TIMEOUT_MS`, default `30000`), and `maxRows` (`ASKDB_STUDIO_EXECUTE_MAX_ROWS`, default `500`). The runtime `studio.execute.databaseUrl` / `file` no longer fall back to the introspection connection unless `useIntrospectionConnection` is `true`. Also exports `DEFAULT_STUDIO_EXECUTE_TIMEOUT_MS` and `DEFAULT_STUDIO_EXECUTE_MAX_ROWS`.

  **askdb**: `askdb init` writes `enabled: true` in the `studio.execute` block when you choose Studio execute. The interactive wizard now defaults that choice to off, matching `--studio-execute`'s documented default.

### Patch Changes

- ab2150b: Bump dependencies: AI SDK (`ai` 7.0.113, `@ai-sdk/*` 4.0.x), zod 4.6, mysql2 3.24, pg 8.23, @prisma/internals 7.10, @inquirer/prompts 8.7, React 19.3 and Vite 8.3 for Studio, and vitest 5 across the workspace.
- 2787b21: Release packaging fixes:

  - Ship `LICENSE` and `NOTICE` in `@askdb/ai`, `@askdb/ai-anthropic`, `@askdb/ai-azure`, `@askdb/ai-google`, `@askdb/ai-openai`, `@askdb/mysql`, `@askdb/sqlite`, and `@askdb/sqlserver` (they were listed in `files` but missing from the tarballs).
  - `@askdb/studio`: React, Radix UI, lucide-react, react-router, clsx, tailwind-merge, and class-variance-authority are bundled into the prebuilt browser client, so they are now dev dependencies and are no longer installed with the package.
  - Add `"sideEffects": false` to library packages (`@askdb/rag` lists its bin entry as side-effectful), and point `homepage` at the relevant askdb.tools page.
  - Package READMEs no longer link to repo-relative paths that npmjs.com cannot resolve.

## 1.0.0-beta.11

### Minor Changes

- 1131e77: CommonJS applications can now `require()` AskDB packages, where package resolution previously failed with `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`. The minimum supported Node.js version is now 22.12, which provides unflagged `require(esm)` support. No runtime behavior or exported symbols changed.

## 1.0.0-beta.10

### Minor Changes

- 0c44b76: Add provider-portable reasoning/latency effort controls for AskDB model calls.

  Set `reasoningEffort: "minimal" | "low" | "medium" | "high"` via `@askdb/ai`'s
  `resolveProviderOptions(config, { reasoningEffort })` and each `@askdb/ai-*`
  adapter maps it to the provider's native knob — OpenAI/Azure
  `providerOptions.openai.reasoningEffort`, Google Gemini 3.x
  `thinkingConfig.thinkingLevel`, Gemini 2.5 `thinkingConfig.thinkingBudget`,
  Anthropic extended `thinking`. Adapters skip models that don't support
  reasoning tuning, so unsupported providerOptions are never sent.

  `@askdb/core`'s `ask()`, `generateSelectSql()`, and `suggestEnrichment()` gain
  an opaque `providerOptions` passthrough forwarded verbatim to `generateText`
  — core stays BYO-model and does not interpret it. Unset, behavior is
  unchanged.

  `askdb.config.*` gains an `ai.reasoning` block (`effort`, `nlToSql`,
  `enrichment`) for per-call-site defaults, flattened to
  `ASKDB_AI_REASONING_EFFORT[_NL_TO_SQL|_ENRICHMENT]` env vars.

  `@askdb/client`'s `createAskDb`/`ask()` now resolve `ai.reasoning` and apply
  it automatically — no manual wiring required for the common client/CLI/HTTP
  API path. `CreateAskDbOptions.reasoningEffort` sets a client-level default;
  `AskOverrides.reasoningEffort` overrides it per call. Studio's sample-question
  and enrichment-suggestion endpoints resolve and forward reasoning effort the
  same way.

  Azure/Foundry deployments are identified by an arbitrary deployment name that
  may not match the underlying model id, so reasoning-model detection can't
  always rely on `model` alone. Set `providerConfig.azure.modelFamily` (or
  `ASKDB_AI_AZURE_MODEL_FAMILY`) to the real model id (e.g. `"gpt-5"`) to
  declare it explicitly when the deployment name doesn't already look like one.

## 1.0.0-beta.9

### Minor Changes

- dc380bc: Add multi-dialect execute support to Studio Query Playground and expose driver-readiness status.

  **`@askdb/config`** — `studio.execute` gains a `provider` field (`"postgres" | "mysql" | "sqlite" | "sqlserver"`) and a `file` field for SQLite. The runtime config resolves the execute provider from: explicit `studio.execute.provider` → active introspection provider (when it is a live engine) → `"postgres"` (backward-compatible default). Connection resolution per provider: Postgres and MySQL and SQL Server use `databaseUrl` (falling back to their introspection URL); SQLite uses `file` (falling back to the introspection file). New canonical env keys: `ASKDB_STUDIO_EXECUTE_PROVIDER` and `ASKDB_STUDIO_SQLITE_FILE`. `ASKDB_STUDIO_DATABASE_URL` is preserved for backward compatibility. New constants: `ASKDB_STUDIO_EXECUTE_PROVIDERS`, `AskDbStudioExecuteProvider`.

  **`@askdb/studio`** — Studio can now execute SQL against Postgres, MySQL, SQLite, and SQL Server from the Query Playground. Each driver (`pg`, `mysql2`, `better-sqlite3`, `mssql`) is an optional peer dependency and is dynamically imported only when needed. New endpoints: `GET /api/execute/status` (returns the configured provider, driver package name, installed status, and install command without ever throwing for a missing driver) and `POST /api/execute/install-driver` (loopback-only; detects the project package manager from the nearest lockfile; installs only the allowlisted package for the configured provider). The Execute button in the Playground shows a compact status row with the provider label, connection/file status, driver readiness, an Install button when the driver is missing (local Studio only), or a manual install command. All four driver packages are added as dev dependencies for local development and CI type-checking; only the driver for the configured dialect needs to be installed by the application at runtime.

## 1.0.0-beta.8

### Minor Changes

- d4a0a1d: Add Anthropic Claude as a supported AI provider, open the config provider union for custom adapters, and make the key-missing message registry-driven.

  **New package: `@askdb/ai-anthropic`** — Set `ASKDB_AI_PROVIDER=anthropic` and `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (or the universal `ASKDB_AI_API_KEY`) to use Anthropic Claude models. The default model is `claude-sonnet-4-6`; override with `ASKDB_AI_MODEL` or `ANTHROPIC_MODEL`. The `anthropic` provider is also configurable via `askdb.config.*` using the new `providerConfig.anthropic` branch (`apiKey`, `model`, `baseUrl`). Anthropic has no embeddings API; `createEmbeddingModel` throws a clear error directing you to configure a separate embedding provider.

  **Registry-driven key-missing message (`@askdb/ai`)** — `AiProviderAdapter` gains an optional `configHint` field. `AiRegistry` gains `keyMissingMessage(context)` that assembles hints from all registered adapters (deduplicated across aliases, stable registration order). The static `aiKeyMissingMessage` export is deprecated in favor of `ai.keyMissingMessage(context)`. All four surfaces (CLI, HTTP API, Studio, TUI) now use the registry method so Anthropic (and any future adapter) is automatically mentioned.

  **Custom provider config branch (`@askdb/config`)** — `AskDbAiConfig` now accepts any provider string, not just the four known literals. Known literals still get dedicated branches with required `providerConfig`; any other string falls through to the new `CustomAiConfig` branch, which flattens to the universal `ASKDB_AI_*` env keys. Custom providers only work end to end when the host registry contains an adapter registered under that provider name — the first-party apps register only first-party adapters.

### Patch Changes

- c0603e1: Resolve the runtime introspection output directory through `@askdb/config` and use it when **`askdb ask`** omits **`--schema`**. Pass **`--schema <path>`** to override.
- 0f0c481: Throw a clear `askdb.config:` error when a first-party provider (`openai`/`azure`/`foundry`/`google`/`anthropic`) is selected without its `providerConfig` branch, instead of crashing with a TypeError during config flattening.

## 1.0.0-beta.7

### Patch Changes

- 05a589a: Fix Studio execute endpoint not reading `databaseUrl` from `askdb.config.*`.

  `POST /api/execute` was reading `ASKDB_STUDIO_DATABASE_URL` directly from `process.env`, which is never populated because `bootstrapAskDbEnv` intentionally does not mutate `process.env`. The studio now reads `studio.execute.databaseUrl` via `getAskDbRuntimeConfig()`.

  `@askdb/config` gains `AskDbRuntimeStudioConfig` (exported) and a `studio` field on `AskDbRuntimeConfig`, making the studio database URL available through the typed runtime config accessor.

## 1.0.0-beta.6

### Major Changes

- 1eacf3f: Remove `database` config section; move connection URLs into `introspection` and `studio`.

  **Breaking:** `AskDbConfig.database` is removed. Move the Postgres connection URL from `database.providerConfig.postgres.databaseUrl` into `introspection.providerConfig.postgres.databaseUrl` (maps to `ASKDB_INTROSPECT_POSTGRES_URL`). The generic `DATABASE_URL` flat key is no longer set by `flattenAskDbConfig`.

  **Breaking:** Studio query execution (`POST /api/execute`) now reads `ASKDB_STUDIO_DATABASE_URL` instead of `DATABASE_URL`. Set `studio.execute.databaseUrl` in `askdb.config.*` (maps to `ASKDB_STUDIO_DATABASE_URL`).

  `AskDbRuntimeIntrospectionConfig` gains a new `postgresDatabaseUrl` field. The `DATABASE_URL` fallback for MySQL and SQL Server introspection is removed; configure those URLs explicitly via `introspection.providerConfig.<engine>.databaseUrl` or `ASKDB_INTROSPECT_MYSQL_URL` / `ASKDB_INTROSPECT_SQLSERVER_URL`.

## 0.3.0-beta.5

### Patch Changes

- 5ceadc8: Allow multiple introspection provider configs in `providerConfig` simultaneously.

  Introduces `IntrospectionProviderConfigs` with all five provider keys (`postgres`, `prisma`, `mysql`, `sqlite`, `sqlserver`) as optional fields. Each `*IntrospectionConfig` branch now accepts the full set instead of only its own key, matching the same pattern already applied to the AI provider config.

- 5ceadc8: Allow multiple provider configs in `providerConfig` simultaneously.

  `providerConfig` now accepts configs for all providers as optional fields, while still requiring the one matching `provider`. This lets a single config object hold credentials for multiple providers and switch between them by changing only the `provider` field.

## 0.3.0-beta.4

### Minor Changes

- 02edcc5: Add Google Gemini as a supported AI provider.

  Set `ASKDB_AI_PROVIDER=google` and `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY` (or the universal `ASKDB_AI_API_KEY`) to use Gemini models. The default model is `gemini-2.0-flash`; override with `ASKDB_AI_MODEL` or `GOOGLE_AI_MODEL`. The `google` provider is also configurable via `askdb.config.*` using the existing `providerConfig.google` branch.

## 0.3.0-beta.3

### Minor Changes

- 1f46cd1: Remove per-app model override config keys (`tui.model`, `studio.model`, `studio.rag`).

  The `tui.model` / `ASKDB_TUI_MODEL` and `studio.model` / `ASKDB_STUDIO_MODEL` config keys are removed — the AI model is now always resolved from the shared `ai` provider config (`ASKDB_AI_MODEL`, `ASKDB_MODEL`, etc.). The `studio.rag` nested block and its `ASKDB_STUDIO_RAG_*` env var aliases are also removed; Studio RAG now reads purely from the top-level `rag` config (`ASKDB_RAG_EMBEDDER*`). The `modelEnvVar` option is removed from `ResolveAskDbAiConfigOptions` as it is no longer needed for language models.

## 0.3.0-beta.2

### Minor Changes

- 07dbc9a: **`askdb.config.ts` now configures MySQL / SQLite / SQL Server directly — no `--engine` flag required.**

  Adds three new discriminated-union branches to `AskDbIntrospectionConfig`, matching the existing postgres / prisma shape:

  ```ts
  introspection: {
    provider: "mysql",
    providerConfig: { mysql: { databaseUrl: env("DATABASE_URL") } },
    outputDir: "./askdb/",
  }
  // or
  introspection: {
    provider: "sqlite",
    providerConfig: { sqlite: { file: "./data/app.db" } },  // path, not URL
    outputDir: "./askdb/",
  }
  // or
  introspection: {
    provider: "sqlserver",
    providerConfig: { sqlserver: { databaseUrl: env("MSSQL_URL") } },
    outputDir: "./askdb/",
  }
  ```

  **Resolution ladder** per engine — first non-empty value wins:
  1. `introspection.providerConfig.<engine>.<field>` (structured)
  2. Provider-specific env key: `ASKDB_INTROSPECT_MYSQL_URL` / `ASKDB_INTROSPECT_SQLITE_FILE` / `ASKDB_INTROSPECT_SQLSERVER_URL`
  3. `DATABASE_URL` fallback — **for MySQL and SQL Server only**. SQLite has no `DATABASE_URL` fallback because file paths and URLs aren't interchangeable.

  **Runtime view.** `AskDbRuntimeIntrospectionConfig` gains resolved per-engine fields:

  ```ts
  introspection: {
    provider: AskDbIntrospectionProvider; // widened to all 5 ids

  **CLI.** `askdb introspect` now defaults `--engine` to `rt.introspection.provider` when the flag isn't passed, so `askdb introspect` works flag-free for every configured engine. Error messages name all three configuration paths (structured / env key / `DATABASE_URL`) so the precedence is discoverable.

  **The `database` block stays Postgres-only** — it's the RAG / pgvector home and isn't widened in this change. Non-Postgres introspection is self-contained inside its own `introspection` branch.

  **Compatibility.** Strictly additive. Existing configs continue to type-check and behave identically; the only widening user code sees is `AskDbRuntimeIntrospectionConfig.provider`, which goes from `"postgres" | "prisma"` to all five ids.

- 57db375: **Discriminated union types for `ai` and `introspection` in `AskDbConfig`** — each `provider` value now enforces exactly the right `providerConfig` branch at compile time (e.g. `provider: "openai"` requires `providerConfig: { openai: OpenaiConfig }` and rejects any other key). Named branch types are exported: `OpenaiAiConfig`, `AzureAiConfig`, `FoundryAiConfig`, `AnthropicAiConfig`, `GoogleAiConfig`, `AskDbAiConfig`, `PostgresIntrospectionConfig`, `PrismaIntrospectionConfig`, `AskDbIntrospectionConfig`.

  **Prisma schema auto-discovery in `@askdb/prisma`** — `discoverPrismaSchemaPath()` is now exported and probes `prisma/schema.prisma`, `schema.prisma`, and `prisma/` (multi-file) in order. Setting `introspection.provider: "prisma"` is now sufficient without an explicit `schemaPath`; the path can still be set via `introspection.providerConfig.prisma.schemaPath` to override discovery.

  **`ASKDB_PRISMA_SCHEMA` env var removed** — the Prisma schema path is read from the bootstrapped structured config (`getAskDbRuntimeConfig().introspection.prismaSchemaPath`) instead of a flat env key. `AskDbRuntimeConfig` gains a typed `introspection` field with `provider`, `prismaSchemaPath`, and `outputDir`.

  **`RUNTIME_SHELL_FLAT_OVERRIDES` removed from bootstrap** — `askdb.config.*` is now the sole source of truth; use `env("VAR")` inside the config file to read from shell or `.env` at load time.

### Patch Changes

- eb325a2: **Dialect-agnostic SQL pipeline moved from `@askdb/postgres` to `@askdb/core`** — `generateSelectSql`, `validateSelectSql`, `buildNlToSqlUserPrompt`, `buildNlToSqlSystemPrompt`, `assertNlToSqlInputs`, and `nlToSqlAmbiguityNotes` are now exported from `@askdb/core` and parameterized by a `DialectSpec`.

  **New `DialectSpec` / `DialectId` types in `@askdb/core`** — `POSTGRES_DIALECT`, `COCKROACHDB_DIALECT`, `BUILT_IN_DIALECTS`, `SUPPORTED_DIALECT_IDS`, `isBuiltInDialectId`, and `getDialectSpec` are exported from `@askdb/core/sql/dialect-spec`, enabling other dialects to plug in without touching `@askdb/postgres`.

  **`@askdb/postgres` re-exports for backwards compatibility** — `postgresDialect` and `PostgresDialect` are re-exported from `@askdb/core` so existing callers continue to work. The NL→SQL SQL logic has been removed from `@askdb/postgres`.

- a4f14f7: **`MYSQL_DIALECT`, `MARIADB_DIALECT`, `SQLITE_DIALECT`, and `SQLSERVER_DIALECT` ship in `@askdb/core`.** All four are registered in `BUILT_IN_DIALECTS` and exported from `@askdb/core`; `ASKDB_DIALECTS` in `@askdb/config` is expanded accordingly so `askdb.config.dialect` autocompletes for every shipped spec.

  **Auto-selection now covers every Prisma provider.** A Prisma user pointed at `mysql`, `sqlite`, or `sqlserver` no longer gets the "AskDB does not yet ship a DialectSpec" error — `askdb introspect` writes the detected provider into `schema.json`, and `askdb ask` (and the HTTP API / Studio) auto-picks the matching dialect.

  **Prompt briefs.** Each spec carries a one-paragraph syntax brief covering quoting, casting, date/time helpers, string concat, and row-limit clauses. Examples: MySQL prompts for `CONCAT()` (since `||` is logical OR), SQL Server for `TOP n` / `OFFSET … FETCH NEXT` (no `LIMIT`), SQLite for `strftime()` and dynamic typing. `SELECT *`-style read-only shape checks (single statement, no comments, no DDL/DML keywords) remain centralized; per-dialect denylists add `ATTACH`/`DETACH`/`PRAGMA`/`REINDEX` (SQLite) and `EXEC`/`MERGE`/`OPENROWSET` (SQL Server).

## 0.3.0-beta.1

### Patch Changes

- 06e5f54: **Breaking for npm consumers:** the CLI is published as the unscoped package **`askdb`** (was `@askdb/cli`). Update `package.json` dependencies and install commands accordingly (`npm i askdb`, `npx askdb init`, etc.). The `askdb` binary name is unchanged.

  Also updates a `@askdb/config` bootstrap doc comment that referenced the old package name, plus README cross-links in `@askdb/introspect` and `@askdb/tui`.

## 0.3.0-beta.0

### Minor Changes

- dc9a6ce: Add `@askdb/config` for Prisma-style `askdb.config.*` / `.config/askdb.*` discovery, `env()` / `defineConfig`, and `bootstrapAskDbEnv()`. Wire bootstrap into the CLI (except `init`), HTTP API, and Studio. `askdb init` writes `askdb.config.ts` only (example `.env` guidance in comments).
- b24af19: **Breaking (`@askdb/config`):** `bootstrapAskDbEnv` installs a runtime snapshot (`getAskDbRuntimeConfig`) instead of merging AskDB settings into `process.env`. Legacy flat `askdb.config` exports are removed; use `defineConfig` only. `getAskDbRuntimeEnv` is removed—pass `getAskDbRuntimeConfig().ai.aiEnv` into `@askdb/core` env helpers.

  **`@askdb/core`:** Document and align with explicit `AskDbAiEnv` from `@askdb/config`.

  First-party apps and RAG/TUI entrypoints read configuration through the runtime façade.

### Patch Changes

- 25980e4: Centralize optional `askdb.config` defaults in `flattenAskDbConfig` instead of `optionalEnv`. `env()` now returns `undefined` when unset; add `requiredEnv` for fail-fast reads. Introduce `defaults.ts`, align the default RAG file-store path with `./askdb/rag`, and emit `ASKDB_PGVECTOR_INDEX_STRATEGY` when flattening pgvector. Refresh the `askdb init` template, root `askdb.config.ts`, and documentation.
