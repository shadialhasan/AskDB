# New AskDB built-in AI provider

You are adding a built-in provider to `@askdb/ai` in the AskDB pnpm monorepo. Since the ADR 0006 amendment (Option E), providers are **not** separate packages: each is one file in `packages/ai/src/providers/`, one row in the built-in table, and one **optional peer dependency** that is loaded lazily. Do **not** create a `packages/ai-<provider>` package — the four `@askdb/ai-*` packages that still exist are deprecated re-export shims scheduled for removal.

This skill is self-contained: follow it top to bottom, run every verification command, and stop at any STOP condition instead of improvising.

## Inputs (resolve these first)

From the user's request, determine — ask only for what cannot be inferred:

1. **`<provider>`** — lowercase id: the `ASKDB_AI_PROVIDER` / `ai.provider` value and `adapter.provider` (e.g. `mistral`, `cohere`, `xai`).
2. **`<sdk>`** — the AI SDK package, normally `@ai-sdk/<provider>`. Confirm it exists: `npm view @ai-sdk/<provider> version`. Confirm its factory API: `npm view @ai-sdk/<provider> readme | head -100` — you need the `create<X>` factory name (e.g. `createMistral`) and whether it exposes `.embedding()` / `.embeddingModel()` or has no embeddings at all. If the factory ships inside `ai` itself (as `createGateway` does), there is no peer package: see `providers/gateway.ts`.
3. **Native env vars** — the provider's conventional key/model/baseURL variables (e.g. `MISTRAL_API_KEY`). Use the names the SDK's own docs use; never invent new ones.
4. **`<defaultModel>`** — a current, real language model id for the provider. Verify against the provider's docs (WebFetch/WebSearch if available); do not trust memory for model ids. For Anthropic specifically, consult the `claude-api` skill if available.
5. **Aliases** — alternative `ASKDB_AI_PROVIDER` spellings users may try (often none).

## Prerequisites — verify before starting

```bash
grep -n "BUILTIN_AI_PROVIDERS" packages/ai/src/providers/index.ts   # must match
grep -n "rethrowMissingPeer" packages/ai/src/providers/optional-peer.ts   # must match
```

**STOP if either grep is empty** — the codebase predates the built-in provider table (ADR 0006 amendment, 2026-09); report that instead of scaffolding a package.

Repo facts you can rely on:

- pnpm workspace; build/lint/test per package via `tsc` and vitest. Root gates: `pnpm build`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm smoke:install`, `pnpm docs:build`.
- Releases use changesets: create a `.changeset/<slug>.md` file by hand (copy the format of any existing file there).
- Conventional commits (`feat(ai): …`).
- Reference providers to diff against: `packages/ai/src/providers/anthropic.ts` (no embeddings) and `packages/ai/src/providers/google.ts` (embeddings + reasoning mapping).

## Step 1 — Provider file

Create `packages/ai/src/providers/<provider>.ts`, following this template:

```ts
import { withEmbeddingProviderOptions } from "../embedding.js";
import { resolveBaseConfig, type AiConfig, type AiProviderAdapter } from "../provider.js";
import { rethrowMissingPeer } from "./optional-peer.js";
import type { BuiltinAiProvider, BuiltinProviderEnvSpec } from "./types.js";

const PEER_PACKAGE = "<sdk>";

const ENV_SPEC: BuiltinProviderEnvSpec = {
  apiKeyVars: ["<PROVIDER>_API_KEY"],
  modelVars: ["<PROVIDER>_MODEL"],          // only if a native convention exists
  embeddingModelVars: ["<PROVIDER>_EMBEDDING_MODEL"], // only if embeddings exist
  baseURLVars: ["<PROVIDER>_BASE_URL"],
  defaultModel: "<defaultModel>",
  // defaultEmbeddingModel only when the provider has a sensible default
};

const CONFIG_HINT =
  "For <ProviderName>, set ai.provider: \"<provider>\" and ai.providerConfig.<provider>.apiKey in askdb.config.*.";

async function createProvider(config: AiConfig) {
  // Literal specifier inside the function: lazy, and no top-level await (a top-level await
  // would break require('@askdb/ai') from CommonJS). Keep `.catch()` chained on the
  // `import()` itself: that is how esbuild and other bundlers tell an optional import from a
  // required one. Wrapping it as `() => import(...)` in a helper makes every host's bundle
  // fail unless this SDK is installed (the installable smoke test's esbuild step checks this).
  const { create<X> } = await import("<sdk>").catch(rethrowMissingPeer("<provider>", PEER_PACKAGE));
  return create<X>({
    apiKey: config.apiKey,
    ...(config.baseURL ? { baseURL: config.baseURL } : {}),
  });
}

export const <provider>Provider: AiProviderAdapter = {
  provider: "<provider>",
  // aliases: ["..."],  // only if real alternative spellings exist
  configHint: CONFIG_HINT,
  resolveConfig(env, options) {
    return resolveBaseConfig("<provider>", env, ENV_SPEC, options);
  },
  async createLanguageModel(config) {
    return (await createProvider(config))(config.model);
  },
  async createEmbeddingModel(config, options = {}) {
    // If the SDK has embeddings: build the model, then forward options under the key the
    // SDK actually reads (verify it in the SDK source — see the contract tests):
    // const model = (await createProvider(config)).embedding(config.model);
    // return withEmbeddingProviderOptions(model, "<provider>", options);
    // If the SDK names the settings differently, pass a mapper, as google.ts does:
    // withEmbeddingProviderOptions(model, "google", options, ({ dimensions }) => ({ outputDimensionality: dimensions }))
    // If the provider has NO embeddings API, make this a plain (non-async) method that throws:
    throw new Error(
      "<ProviderName> does not provide an embeddings API. Configure a different " +
        "embedding provider while using <ProviderName> for chat.",
    );
  },
  // resolveProviderOptions(config, { reasoningEffort }) — only if the provider has a
  // reasoning knob; return undefined for models that don't support it.
};

export const <provider>Builtin: BuiltinAiProvider = {
  provider: "<provider>",
  label: "<ProviderName>",
  aliases: [],
  peerPackage: PEER_PACKAGE,
  env: ENV_SPEC,
  configHint: CONFIG_HINT,
  adapter: <provider>Provider,
};
```

Rules:

- Provider-specific connection settings beyond apiKey/baseURL/model (an Azure-style resource name, region, project id) go into `config.providerOptions` inside a custom `resolveConfig` wrapper around `resolveBaseConfig`, never as new `AiConfig` fields — see `packages/ai/src/providers/azure.ts`, including validation that throws a clear message when a required setting is missing.
- Auth that is not an API key (OAuth, SigV4/AWS credentials): **STOP and report** — `AiConfig.apiKey` is required by contract and the no-key-means-disabled rule; that contract change needs its own design pass.

## Step 2 — Register it

1. Add `<provider>Builtin` to `BUILTIN_AI_PROVIDERS` in `packages/ai/src/providers/index.ts` (display order: append unless told otherwise) and re-export `<provider>Provider` there and from `packages/ai/src/index.ts`.
2. In `packages/ai/package.json` **and** `packages/client/package.json`, add `<sdk>` to `peerDependencies` and `peerDependenciesMeta` (`{ "optional": true }`). `@askdb/client` re-declares the optional peers so strict installs (Yarn PnP) can pass them through to `@askdb/ai`. The peer floor is the oldest `<sdk>` version the contract tests pass against, not the latest. A floor that's too high is a hard `ERESOLVE` for hosts on an older SDK. `pnpm test:ai-floors` (also run by CI and `pnpm preflight`) installs every peer at its `^` floor in a scratch project and runs the `@askdb/ai` tests there; run it after Step 3 and raise the floor only if it fails for a reason you can't fix in the provider.
3. Add `<sdk>` to `dependencies` of the batteries-included surfaces: `apps/cli`, `apps/http-api`, `apps/studio`. No code changes there — they call `createAiRegistry()`, which registers every built-in.
4. If the Vercel AI Gateway serves this provider's models under a `<provider>/` prefix and the provider has reasoning or embedding options, add it to `UPSTREAM_ADAPTERS` in `packages/ai/src/providers/gateway.ts` (and to the gateway's embedding mapping if its embedding option names differ).

## Step 3 — Tests

- `packages/ai/src/providers/<provider>.test.ts`, modeled on `anthropic.test.ts` (pure functions, no SDK mocks). Required cases: `resolveConfig` resolves the native key var; default model applied; returns `undefined` when no key is configured; any `resolveProviderOptions` mapping.
- `packages/ai/src/providers/<provider>.contract.test.ts`, modeled on `openai.contract.test.ts`: the **real** SDK with `vi.stubGlobal("fetch")`, asserting the request URL and HTTP body carry the model id, a configured `baseURL`, any provider options you emit, and embedding options (or the throw with a message containing "embeddings"). Don't mock the `@ai-sdk/*` package — a mock echoes its input and can't see what the SDK actually sends.
- Update the expectations in `packages/ai/src/registry.test.ts` (built-in names/order, peer table, setup helpers) and `packages/ai/src/provider.test.ts` (`aiKeyMissingMessage`).
- The installable smoke test (`examples/installable-smoke/run.sh`) loads every row of `BUILTIN_AI_PROVIDERS` in the app sandbox, so it needs no edit; it fails if the apps don't depend on `<sdk>`.

**Verify**: `pnpm install && pnpm --filter @askdb/ai build && pnpm --filter @askdb/ai test` → exit 0.

## Step 4 — Config branch (required for built-ins)

`packages/client/src/provider-config-drift.test.ts` fails until `@askdb/config` knows the provider: it flattens every config branch and resolves it through the registry, so the id list, env var names, and default model must all agree. `@askdb/config` must not depend on `@askdb/ai`, so mirror it there:

- `src/constants.ts`: append `<provider>` to `ASKDB_AI_PROVIDERS`.
- `src/defaults.ts` (+ export from `src/index.ts`): `DEFAULT_<PROVIDER>_LANGUAGE_MODEL`, equal to `ENV_SPEC.defaultModel`. New providers add a language-model default; embedding models have no defaults.
- `src/types.ts`: a `<Provider>Connection` type, add it to `AiProviderConnections`.
- `src/flatten.ts`: `applyProviderConnectionEnv` writes env keys the provider reads (`apiKeyVars[0]`, a `baseURLVars` entry).
- `src/config.test.ts`: flatten tests for the new connection; update the `ASKDB_AI_PROVIDERS` list test.
- `src/scaffold/ai.ts` (`@askdb/config/scaffold`): if the provider can't start without a setting beyond the API key and model (as Azure needs `resourceName`), add it to `renderAskDbAiConfigScaffold`. `askdb init` and Studio's setup wizard both render the `ai` block through it, so this is the only place to change.

Hand-maintained lists outside `@askdb/ai` and `@askdb/config` (everything else derives from `BUILTIN_AI_PROVIDERS` or `ASKDB_AI_PROVIDERS`):

- `apps/studio/src/web/views/setup/types.ts` (`AI_PROVIDERS`, `SetupAiProvider`): Studio's browser bundle can't import `@askdb/ai`. `apps/studio/src/setup-providers.test.ts` fails until it matches.
- `PROVIDER_WIRING` in `apps/studio/src/web/views/playground/GetTheCodePanel.tsx`: the "Get the code" snippet.

These derive and need no change: `askdb init`'s choices, validation, and `--help` (`apps/cli/src/init.ts`, `apps/cli/src/cli.ts`), Studio's server-side setup (`apps/studio/src/setup.ts`) and its request type (`apps/studio/src/shared/api.ts`), and the smoke test's provider loop.

**Verify**: `pnpm build && pnpm lint && pnpm test` → exit 0.

## Step 5 — Docs

- `docs/integration/installable-package.md`: add a provider recipe section (env form + `askdb.config.ts` form), formatted like the existing provider sections.
- `packages/ai/README.md`: add the provider to the built-in provider table.
- Find every page that lists the built-ins and add the provider there: `git grep -n -i "anthropic" apps/docs-site/src apps/docs-site/public docs/architecture.md docs/integration`. When `gateway` was added, that meant:
  - `guides/bring-your-own-model.mdx`: the config tab and the direct-model tab;
  - `reference/cli.mdx`: the `--ai-provider` values;
  - `reference/client-api.mdx`: the default list for `providers`;
  - `reference/config.mdx`: the env-var table, the list of built-ins, and the reasoning mapping sentence;
  - `reference/packages.mdx`: the install tabs and the other provider mentions;
  - `apps/docs-site/public/AGENTS.md` and `docs/architecture.md`.
  Match the surrounding formatting.

**Verify**: `pnpm docs:build` → exit 0.

## Step 6 — Changeset and final gate

Create `.changeset/add-<provider>-provider.md`: minor for `@askdb/ai`, `@askdb/config`, `@askdb/client` (its manifest gains the optional peer), and `askdb`, `@askdb/http-api`, `@askdb/studio` (each accepts a new provider). State the env vars, the default model, the peer package to install, and the config branch. Run `pnpm changeset status` and confirm no package is planned for a major bump.

**Final gate (all must pass):**

```bash
pnpm build && pnpm lint && pnpm test
pnpm smoke:install
pnpm docs:build
pnpm preflight   # frozen install, audit, the @askdb/ai tests at the peer floors, publish dry-run
git status   # only intended files changed
```

## STOP conditions

- `@ai-sdk/<provider>` doesn't exist, is unmaintained, or its major version differs from the `@ai-sdk/*` majors already in the repo — report options instead of pinning blind.
- The SDK factory doesn't follow the `create<X>(settings)(modelId)` shape.
- Auth is not API-key based (see Step 1).
- The prerequisite greps fail.
- Any final-gate command fails twice after a reasonable fix attempt.
