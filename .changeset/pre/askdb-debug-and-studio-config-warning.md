- `@askdb/config`: new `isAskDbDebugEnabled()` export. It returns `true` when the `ASKDB_DEBUG` shell variable is `1` or `true` (case-insensitive), and reads `process.env` directly so binaries can use it when the config fails to load. The `askdb` CLI uses it to decide whether to print stack traces.
- `@askdb/studio`: when `askdb.config.*` exists but fails to load, `askdb-studio` (and `askdb studio`) print `askdb-studio: warning: <path> could not be loaded, so Studio is ignoring it: <error>` and start without it, instead of starting silently. The setup wizard still never overwrites an existing config.
- Docs: the CLI reference documents `--help`/`--version`, which commands work without a config, the missing-config message, and `ASKDB_DEBUG`; troubleshooting matches the real missing-config error and covers configs that fail to load.
